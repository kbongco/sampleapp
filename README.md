<h1>Laboratory Sample Management App</h1>

<h3>About</h3>

This is an idea I came up with when I was previously working in the food industry as a laboratory technician. In my 
previous positions, we often had to log the samples and whatever was made in the lab for testing or for batching, 
however in most positions I worked for, a sharepoint excel sheet was used. This also often led to problems such as
only one person would be able to edit the excel sheet one at a time, so if someone were to leave the sheet open it would 
cause the others to not be able to edit the excel sheet for their samples, and of course if the excel sheet wasn't maintained
properly it wouldn't be easy to filter through all the samples that were submitted, just a few problems that would happen. 

Right now this is very rough, I plan to add a search bar as well as authentication and having the view section of the app
look more presentable. 

At first glance, it looks very similiar to one of my early projects that I did when I was taking 
Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer, but now I am learning how to add extra features into this to 
make it more presentable and more functional! 

<h5>Current updates</h5>
I have a text file with a bugs/testing/updates log with this. Its just a way
for me to keep track of what I'm doing and also a way to catch all the bugs
and problems and write down what I've learned trying to fix it.
